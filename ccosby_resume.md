## 2012/10 - Current
### Cisco Systems, Inc.
##### Software Engineer, DNCS Platform

This position has defined much of my career. The "Platform" responsibility is
more systems integration and automation than software engineer. I'm
responsible for making our products installable by "a homeless person with no
computer experience". I've learned to write scripts of all types: Bourne
shell, Korn shell, BASH, Perl, Python, Ruby, etc. The product was initially
shipped on Sun SPARC hardware. From there, we worked on recompiling to SunOS
i386 and installing it on VMware. My job is creating the glue required to make
upgrading versions happen with as little downtime as possible. Moving a running
application stack from SunOS SPARC to SunOS i386 under VMware, while migrating
a half terabyte Informix database requires a lot of tools and an ability to
make things work together that were never designed to.

## 2011/02 - 2012/10
### Cisco Systems, Inc.
##### DevOps, Femtocell

I was recruited out of DNCS Platform to help automate the development
infrastructure for the Femtocell project. This involved installation and
management of the continuous integration environment and converting the builds
from ant and custom "build.sh" scripts into Maven, with full artifact release
integration with Artifactory. This one was a lot of fun right up until the
project was moved offshore to reduce OpEx.

## 2005/03 - 2011/02
### Scientific-Atlanta, Inc. / Cisco Systems, Inc.
##### Software Engineer, DNCS Platform

See 2012-10 - Current section above. Same job, just split around a brief foray
into the world of cell phone micro-towers.

## 2000/07 - 2005/03
### Scientific-Atlanta, Inc.
##### Network Engineer, SciCare Software Services

This position started as a "Level 3" support engineer. Duties were initially
limited to resolving problems with our application stack running on Solaris.
They very soon included maintaining site-to-site VPN connectivity to customer
locations, creating a website to provide security for the VPN connections, and
other development duties. It went on to be a small application development
group, doing a great deal of PHP websites that we used to bring profit to a
pure cost center.

## 1999/06 - 2000/07
### Associated Distributors dba West Building Materials
##### Developer / IT Specialist

West Building Materials was a 100 year old building materials store that
didn't survive the market incursion by Home Depot and Lowe's. My
responsibilities here were centered around rollout of a new point of sale
system to 30+ store locations in the US southeast. I also wrote many of the
custom reports and applications (Progress 4GL again) that replaced the
outgoing POS system. This job also kickstarted my desire to automate
everything. Executing the rollout of the stores was started by another
employee who didn't take the time to make all of the servers an easily
maintainable homogenous environment - every one was a little different. I
fixed that with a couple of carefully crafted backup tapes and good old
Lone-Tar.

## 1996/05 - 1999/05
### Health Data, Inc.
##### Lead Developer

Health Data is where I cut my technical teeth. This was a data-entry job that
turned into a software engineering role and escalated from there. I started
with maintaining and improving an aging data entry application (Progress 4GL),
while learning the language. From there I moved into developing drug use
review software and eventually a DICOM and HL7 compliant medical imaging
application suite. My small team of 2 developers built applications in
Progress 4GL and Visual Basic to provide a workstation to scan X-ray films,
recieve a feed from the CT, MRI, and ultrasound machines and display them in a
Windows application that was located both inside the hospital and at the home
of the radiologist on call. I also rebuilt and managed the building LAN, built
and maintained all of the Windows workstations, the SCO OpenServer 5 Progress
database servers, and the Linux mail/web/DNS gateway.
